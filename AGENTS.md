# Agent Instructions

- Read `README.md` at the start of each session for project conventions.
- When asked to propose or create a commit message, check the scope list in `README.md` and use a matching scope when appropriate. If none fits, suggest a new scope and note it.
- If changes can be cleanly split into multiple independent commits, prefer that.
